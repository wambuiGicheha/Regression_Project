**Author**: Keziah Gicheha, Dave Omondi, Pamela Okinyo, Charles Ndegwa, Brian Kipng'eno

## Overview
This project aims to provide actionable insights for a real estate agency on how home renovations can increase the estimated value of homes in King County. The business problem addressed is the need to advise homeowners on the most impactful renovations to maximize their property's value. Using the King County House Sales dataset, which includes features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, living area square footage, and more, we employ multiple linear regression and other statistical methods to analyze the relationship between these features and home prices. Our results indicate that certain renovations, particularly those that include increasing living area and upgrading amenities, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, significantly boost home value. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing specific types of renovations to achieve the highest return on investment for homeowners.

## Business Problem
The primary business problem is the need for a real estate agency to provide data-driven advice to homeowners on how home renovations can enhance the value of their properties. Homeowners often invest in renovations without clear guidance on which improvements will yield the highest return on investment. By addressing this pain point, the agency can offer more valuable services to clients, enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing the agency's market share.
